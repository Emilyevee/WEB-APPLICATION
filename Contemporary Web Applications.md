      <p> The aim of this report was to create a single page web application that would support Solent Universitys students in their day to day lives. For this project the specific aim was to create a bugdeting application that students could use everyday to check and anaylse there spending in order to reduce the number of students going into their overdrafts. Within the first phase of this project a design was made to show how the SPA would look and function and show different pages that would be accessible; For the second part of this assessment the application was developed baseed on a new method and from the feedback gained from the protoype of the application.

       When beginning phase two of this project is was firstly important to decide on a methology to use in order to get the best results, research was undertaken into serval different methods including Devops, waterfall and Agile; For this project the methodlogy chosen was waterall. 
       Waterfull methodology was chosen due to its's clarity and structure; This method included several stages which are requiremnts, design, implementation, verification and maintence. The first two sections of this method was completed in phase one which was estabilsihing the requirments (done through surveys and focus groups) and the design of the applicaiton. The next phase was to develop the design into a Single web page applicaiton, this was completed by creacting a react applicaiton and implementing the different design sections such as the components , pages and styles (as shown in the code ); The application was then deployed using firebase in order to make it accessible and to increase the security of the website. 
  An advantaged to using this methodology was that each stage was clearly laid out meaning nothing would get missed, as well it also allowed for a clear time scale to be created, seeing as the project needed to be completed by the 14/1/22 it was helpful to set deadlines for each section. As well as this annother benefit was being able to look for erros during the design phase before moving on to implementing the design, once the design section was completed feedback was collected on the overall design which allowed for changes to be made when doing the implemention, for example one element changed was pulling in spending data as this would be quite a complex and would require alot of security checks.

       To complete the final stage of this methododoy the last part was to complete user testing;
